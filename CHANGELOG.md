## 0.15.0

### Added

- Added a tree view that allows to parse `QuestData.txt` from Daggerfall Unity saves and lists all serialized quest data in it. Clicking an entry opens corresponding quest file, with decorations for set/unset tasks and unstarted/running/stopped clocks. Hover provider is also used to show json data (with a markdown codeblock) for each quest resource, filtering its children. For example only task data is shown for a task, while each action data is shown for corresponding action.

### Improved

- Use Semantic Highlighting instead of decoration styling for conditions and actions that affect quest workflow, action and symbol parameters and symbols that don't follow standard syntax and can't benefit of syntax highlighting.
- Updated list of actions.

## 0.12.0

### Added

- Added diagnostic information for obsolete action `create npc at _place_` and obsolete overload `get item _item_ from _person_` with severity level of 'Information'.
- Added syntax highlighting for global variables.
- Added decoration styling to conditions and actions that affect quest workflow, action and symbol parameters and sybols that don't follow standard syntax and can't benefit of syntax highlighting.

## 0.11.0

### Added

- Implemented provider of folding ranges for QRC, QBN, message, task and comment blocks.
- Numeric identifiers of additional messages can now be "renamed". Static messages can't be renamed because id is associated to alias.
- Added word highlight for symbol types.
- Added diagnostic for quest names inside quest tables. Quests are seeked in the directory where the table is located.
- Added hovers, find definition and references for quest names inside quest tables.
- Issue a warning and a quick fix if the value of the `Quest:` directive is different than the name of file without extension.

### Improved

- Updated list of actions and effects.

## 0.10.0

### Added

- Diagnostics for references to undefined quests.
- QuickFix: suggest best match for reference to unknown quest.
- When `entry` is typed inside a table a snippet insertion and signature info following the table schema are prompted.

- Refactoring: switch among message text aliases if more than one is available.
- Added command **Order messages** (`dftemplate.orderMessages`), also available as a code action, which sorts messages by id.
- Added command **Generate global variables** (`dftemplate.generateGlobalVariables`), also available as a code action on the `QBN` directive, which generates missing global variables selected from a prompt.

### Improved

- Go to Definition shows both symbol and task for clocks.
- Improved documentation support for actions with multiple overloads.
- Improved documentation for several actions.
- Default name of global variables is formed from their aliases. For example the proposed name for `FinishedMantellanCrux` is `_finishedMantellanCrux_`.
